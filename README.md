# **terminal-profile**
My personal Windows 10 terminal profile setup, based on Monokai.

## TODO
Add support for:
 - cmd.exe (old terminal)
 - Azure Cloud Shell
 - Ubuntu (WSL)

And possibly more, but I don't have more installed.

## How to install
Go to `%LOCALAPPDATA\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState` and drop profiles.json there.
Then simply restart your terminal and boom, you now have a nice looking terminal!
